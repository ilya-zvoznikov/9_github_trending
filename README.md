# Github Trends

The app shows 20 top repos and their open issues from [GitHub](https://github.com)

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. 
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclop
edia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quickstart

To use run the app from command line

```bash
$ python github_trending.py
